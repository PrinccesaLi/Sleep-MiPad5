# Sleep-MiPad5
This is the README file for Sleep1.5.  This program is designed for ARM processors and runs under Windows.  It simulates sleep mode by creating a black window, lowering the brightness to a minimum and blocking the rotation of the window.  This program can be useful when you need to simulate sleep mode on your computer, for example, to save battery power or just hide your activity.

 To start using the program, download the .exe file and place it in any place convenient for you.  Then run the .exe file and a black window should appear on your screen.  The screen brightness will be reduced to the minimum and you will not be able to rotate the window.  To exit the program, press the side volume button up or down.

 Thank you for using Sleep1.5!  If you have any questions or problems with the program, please contact us.
